            "Modelling SummaryModelling based on 13 diesel generators - assessment has assumed Cummins C3750 D5e 7.5MW units.Each generator may be in operation for up to 50 hours a year, to include hours required for maintenance and testing.Information from technical specifications, building configuration, proposed flue location/heights and the proposed testing and maintenance schedule have been used to inform the process conditions. It has been assumed that selective catalytic reduction (SCR) will be installed and will be effective after the first 20 minutes of each test/maintenance run.Emissions from the diesel generators would include NO2, PM10and PM2.5(all particulate matter (PM10and PM2.5) has assumed to be present as PM10). Results of the dispersion modelling can be summarised as follows: Exceedances of the annual mean NO2objective are not predicted at any modelled locations. The maximum predicted environmental concentration (PEC) concentration is 33.2µg/m3, below the annual mean objective (40 µg/m3).Exceedances of the hourly mean NO2objective are not predicted at any modelled receptors. The maximum hourly PEC is 68.28µg/m3, below the hourly mean objective (200 µg/m3).Exceedances of the annual mean PM10objective are not predicted at any modelled receptors. The maximum PEC is 19.0µg/m3, which is below the annual mean objective (40 µg/m3).Exceedances of the 24-hour mean PM10objective are not predicted at any modelled receptors. The maximum predicted PEC based on 90.4thpercentile is 19.1µg/m3, which is below the 24-hour mean objective (50 µg/m3).ConclusionThe assessment has demonstrated that  based on the assumptions listed above, the impact of emissions from the proposed on-site generators on the exposure of nearby sensitive receptors to poor air quality is predicted to be negligible and is therefore not considered to be significant. \n",

The design has developed since Stage 2 and has now addresses previous building control comments raised in previous stage reviews - the key element being the stage 3 fire strategy which now provides additional detail to support the overall fire strategy. There are no material issues within the stage 3 design which will affect compliance, however, we expect the items in our tracker to be addressed with the stage 4 design. Sweco Building Control have advised the design team on relevant aspects of the Building Regulations, provided reasonable assistance in relation to Building Regulations approvals when requested and undertaken a formal assessment of the Stage 3 design. At this point in the design SwecoBuilding Control have prepared a building control tracker which identifies the building control issues related to the separate building control regulations A-Q. We expect the remaining tracker issues to be addressed within the Stage 4 design, at which point Sweco will be able to carry out our statutory consultations with the fire authority and obtain their agreement of the fire strategy design. Once complete and with all tracker items addressed, we will be able to issue a design approval. Sweco Building Control Limited is an Approved Inspector licenced by the Construction Industry Council Approved Inspectors Register (CICAIR) to carry out Building Control Function in England and Wales and as such has no design input.Building Control ComplianceIntroductionProgrammePlanningArchitecturalLandscapeStructuralGeotechnicalCivilMechanicalElectricalITSecuritySustainability and EnvironmentalCost InformationSupporting InformationFire ProtectionControlsTransportationVertical TransportationBuilding Control ComplianceBIMCFDPublic HealthCDM\n",
